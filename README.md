# Sentiment Analysis Web Application (NLP)

This project implements an end-to-end **Sentiment Analysis system** that classifies user-provided text as **Positive** or **Negative** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.  
An interactive and user-friendly web interface is built using **Gradio** to demonstrate real-time predictions.
